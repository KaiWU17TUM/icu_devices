# Urine scale designed by Dr Eichhorn
* This device is used for measuring the volume of liquid. It use a force sensor to measure the grativity and transform the value to volume.
The data is transmitted through wireless Zigbee to the PC.
* The main component of this device are 
1. Battery for power supply
2. Arduino Uno as control unit
3. HX711 weight sensor
4. Zigbee schield and receiver

* Here is a link to the Arduino code for interacting with HX711 weight sensor.
